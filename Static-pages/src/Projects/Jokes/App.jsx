/**
 * Challenge: create a page that displays your favorite jokes
 * - Create a Joke component in its own file.
 * - Import and render 4-5 <Joke /> components
 * - Each Joke should receive a "setup" prop and a "punchline" prop
 *   and render those however you'd like
 * - Use your favorite 2-part jokes (setup & punchline), or check
 *   jokes.md file for some examples.
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT:
 * Some jokes are only a punchline with no setup
 * 

 * Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that 
 * isn't a string datatype.
 * 
 * E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" 
 * and "downvotes" prop that is a number, as well as a prop with 
 * an array of comments, and a boolean of whether the joke is a 
 * pun (`isPun`).
 *
 * Challenge: pass props to the Entry component to display
 * its data. See the `data.md` file for each prop name and its
 * value.
 * 
 * Then on the Entry component, receive and display the values
 * for those props.
